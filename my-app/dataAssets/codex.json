        "Opt for Oil-Blotting Papers": "Blotting papers can help manage oiliness in the T-zone without the need to wash your face multiple times a day. This is a great way to control shine without disrupting your skin’s balance. Use blotting papers as needed, particularly in the afternoon when oil production tends to increase.",
        "Get Enough Sleep": "Sleep is critical for skin regeneration and repair. Lack of sleep can increase stress hormones, which may lead to increased oil production and dehydration in the skin."
